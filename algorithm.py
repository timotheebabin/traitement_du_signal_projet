        Initialize in the constructor all the parameters required for
        creating the signature of the audio files. These parameters include for
        instance:
        - the window selected for computing the spectrogram
        - the size of the temporal window

        To Do
        -----

        This function takes as input a sampled signal s and the sampling
        frequency fs and returns the fingerprint (the hashcodes) of the signal.
        The fingerprint is created through the following steps
        - spectrogram computation
        - local maxima extraction
        - hashes creation

        Implement all these operations in this function. Keep as attributes of
        the class the spectrogram, the range of frequencies, the anchors, the 
        list of hashes, etc.

        Each hash can conveniently be represented by a Python dictionary 
        containing the time associated to its anchor (key: "t") and a numpy 
        array with the difference in time between the anchor and the target, 
        the frequency of the anchor and the frequency of the target 
        (key: "hash")
